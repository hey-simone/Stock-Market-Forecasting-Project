# Stock-Market-Forecasting-Project
Forecasting Stock Prices and Generating Buy Sell Signals with the Python Data Science Stack.


This is the first project I did with the Python data science stack. It is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub which can be found above. It covers a range of concepts and techniques including tools, data sources, data exploration and visualization, handling missing data, domain specific considerations and modeling. 

The purpose of this study is to explore the use and effectiveness of the data science and machine learning ecosystem of tools in Python with application to stock price prediction and algorithmic trading techniques. Two forecasting scenarios are explored:

- Predicting prices on a particular day using regression, and
- Generating buy/sell signals with Bollinger Bands

Various models are explored and compared including, Random Forests, SVMs and Linear Regression.
